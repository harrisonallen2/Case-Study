SoFi 

Case Study By: Harrison Allen
Overview and Origin

SoFi which is short for (Social Finance) is an online finance company that lets the average person have complete control of their personal finances. The company was founded in August of 2011 by Mike Cagney, Dan Macklin, James Finnigan, and Ian Brady. The idea for SoFi came from those four Stanford Graduate Students who were trying find a way to balance their personal finances and their student debt. SoFi has been receiving loans to keep the company funded. The company just surpassed $6 billon in funded loans. 

Business Activities 

The financial problem that SoFi is the absurd amount of student loan debt that graduates are coming home with. SoFi intended customer is college graduates or anyone struggling with student loan debt and who wants to gain control of them of portfolio. The difference between SoFi and their competitors is that they connect students with recent graduates and alumni to help one another find ways to help with lowering student loan debt. In terms of the technologies that are running SoFi, Galileo Financial Technologies was just acquired by SoFi to be their main API and payment platform. Galileo is based in Salt Lake City but it a world leader in API and digital payments. 

Landscape

SoFi is in the money management domain of the finical industry. The money management domain of the finical industry has had a multitude of changes in the last 20 years. Mostly for the average nonprofessional broker who wants to learn how to control their own finances. SoFi found a way to help people manage their own money for a reason a lot of people need money and that is to get out of student loan debt. As of right now SoFi is the leading innovator in money management based of student loan debt in the FinTech industry. 

Results

The impact of SoFi is that it is now easier for people in student loan debt to help each other get out of it and manage their own finances. SoFi is a member-based app and so the metric for success is the amount the members that are subscribes to SoFi. By 201 it is projected that SoFi will have 3 million members. Compared to other money management SoFi’s 3 million member is far behind Robinhood’s 13 million in 2020 but SoFi is still growing. 

Recommendations

If I were an advisor for SoFi I would create a software that would link the user’s student loan account with the SoFi app and create a specific portfolio based on the users age, debt, and the earing goals that the users want to set. This would make SoFi completely devoted to the single person and would almost act as an advisor without the advisor cost. This product would require mainly just coding and development software. This technology would make the user feel like the SoFi experience is complexly geared toward them, and their life goals of being debt free.
